## Summary

This War of Mine is a statergy side scrolling adventure game where the player manages normal civilian survivors during a war time. The game is played in two phases day time and night time. During the day the player manages the place the survivors are staying at by building crafting tables, making food, or possibly just putting the survivors to rest. In the night phase the player can decided between scavengenging, defending the house, or sleeping for each suvivor. If any survior is set to scavenge then they will show that suvivor at the place of choice to scavenge and have to sneak around and gather materials. 

## Final Thoughts

The last time I played This War of Mine was a little after inital releasse during which they have had a slew of updates. Currently the game has some really nice options of creating your own story by choosing each suvivor, each place that shows on the map, what staritng point, and also it lets you create a custom survivor. The normal mode is playing a story based on a survivor which is just a predetermined set up. The actual game play itself is solid and pretty fun, if you are into that management game and min maxing. During both phases, day and night, you are timed so figuring out what you want to do during that time and doing it quickly is a big part of the gameplay. Overall the game has been a good game since its release and with the new content, dlc, and mod support it only adds to how polished the game is.
