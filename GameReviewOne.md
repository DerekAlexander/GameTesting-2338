## Summary
A scientist creates a machine where if he dies, he can be revived at instantly. In the game you're playing as a scientist who can manipulate his machine over and through obstacles to navigate different areas. As you play, dying in any way possible,  whether it be by helicopter blades or jumping off of a building, the player will respawn where his machine is.

## Final Thoughts
The theme and mechanics of the game are different, interesting and engaging but felt grossly incomplete. I first noticed this when I started the game and had issues with the unsupported Unity plug-in. I attempted to open game with two different computers. I had to use three different browsers on each computer and finally got it to work only once with the help of external software. It seems there was not enough time and work put into the game to live up to the potential I saw that it had. To me, it felt as if the game were more like a prototype than a finished, fleshed out game. I also encountered two bugs. One of them hindered game play because when the player tapped tab, it would stop the charge of a throw until it was pressed again. Secondly, when the throwing the machine a certain way, it seemed to catch on the characterâ€™s chin. That would consequently block the throw, sending the machine flying straight behind the character.
