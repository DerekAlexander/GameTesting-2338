## Summary
A scientist creates a machine where if he dies, he can be revived at instantly. In the game you're playing as a scientist who can manipulate his machine over and through obstacles to navigate different areas. As you play, dying in any way possible,  whether it be by helicopter blades or jumping off of a building, the player will respawn where his machine is.

## Final Thoughts
The theme and mechanics of the game are different and interesting but sadly feels very incomplete. It seems there was not enough time and work put into the game to live up to its potential. With that being said, it felt as if the game were more like that of a short demo than a completely finished, fleshed out game. Another thing that I noticed was two different bugs. One of these bugs hindered game play. The first was hitting tab stopped the charge of a throw until tab was pressed again. Second was throwing the machine towards the characters chin blocked the throw sending it flying backwards.
