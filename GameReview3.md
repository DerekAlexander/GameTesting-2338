## Final Thoughts
I played this game when it came out originally and remember enjoying it but playing through it again, I did not remember how witty and humorous the game was. It was hard to stop playing it to write this review as I really wanted to see what witty comments the player character could make next. Where this comes in specifically is when accepting missions and getting details you as a player are given usually 3 option in how to respond. Each dialog response has a different reaction from the person you are responding too. The gameplay as well is full of options. You can choose how to approach each puzzle either by lethal, non-lethal, silent or quick as the game grades you on your time spent. Some of my favorite methods to use are slamming doors in guards face to knock them out or tricking the guards into shooting each other. Another feature that really make this game feel great is the ability to purchase gadgets to fit your play style. It also provides tons of replay ability as it grades each puzzle by violence, witnesses, noise, time and give the player during any playthrough to replay a level for a better score. Overall the game gives the player so much choice in how to play and how to do each and every level I feel it would be a joy for anyone to play.
