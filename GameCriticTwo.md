## Summary
Shoppe Keep 2 is an interesting management game where the player is the shop keeper instead of the hero. The developer of Shoppe Keep 2, from here on known as SK2, is Strange Fire Studios known mainly for this game series. The game play of SK2 revolves around the player buying, selling, and crafting different items to be sold at their player designed shop. Playing SK2 there are a few functionalities that I feel testers would be interested in.

The functionality of buying an item from the restock window would be of great importance to a tester. Seeing if an item is added at the correct quantity and the player currency is correctly removed. Another function that would be tested is the npc buying a placed item, there is also the ability to buy directly from the players inventory. If the npc chooses to buy an item the selected item should be removed and the value of that item added to the players bank. Lastly the function of placing an item from the player inventory should be analyzed. When placing an item, it should be checked if the items size matches the placement slots size. Only one of the selected items should be removed the players inventory and lastly the item should correctly appear in the world at that placed spot.

These three functions are the main gameplay loop functions that a tester would need to check thoroughly when working on Shoppe Keep 2.
