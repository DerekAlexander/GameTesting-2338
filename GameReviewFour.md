## Summary
  Stardew Valley is a 2d casual RPG game where the player inherits his grandfather’s farm. After city life becomes too much the player moves out to the country to run the farm. A few of the main features of the game are planting crops, tending to animals, socializing with the towns people, dungeon crawling and fishing. The overarching goal of the game is to complete different challenges and seeing the grandfather’s ghost.  
## Final Thoughts
  Stardew Valley was enjoyable for me because of its farming and dungeon crawling mechanics. Being able to say this is what I think makes Stardew Valley so enjoyable for a wide range of people. Players are given a choice in play style and what activities to do. While the player may choose not to do certain activities every one of them are well made and enjoyable even if it was not my cup of tea. Even while having so many different play style options I feel the game keeps true to its casual nature and keeps every mechanic simplistic and easy to grasp quickly.  
  The story might be its weakest point in my opinion but not being a big story person, this does not bother me much. For someone looking for a rich deep story experience they might be disappointed in the shallow and predictable character stories of the towns people. 
I did find a graphical bug when going to the loading screen that should be mentioned. When playing the game in a resolution over 1920 by 1080 the stars in the background do not scale well. The result is a square of stars in the top left but none on the remaining part of the screen outside of this resolution. This was tested by going to a 4k resolution and back down to 1080p and checking the loading screen each time.  
  Bugs aside, I think Stardew Valley is a game that almost anyone can enjoy and an easy to recommend game to someone who never really plays any games. Adding to the fact recently multiplayer was made for this game makes it even more recommendable as a decent co-op game.
