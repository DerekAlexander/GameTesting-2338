## Summary
Overcooked! is a couch co-op focused simulation game where you chop up food, cook it, and many other task to manage while trying to create the required dishes in time. Overcooked has a main campaign story as well as two other stories the lost morsel, and festive seasonings. The visual ascetics of overcooked are cute while simple in fidelity with low polygon models. Controls wise the game simple with only movement W,A,S,D , alt for a speed boost, and control to start an action. Since I was playing solo I was given two character and could switch between them with shift. This caused even the tutorial level to be very hectic and I wouldn't suggest playing like this. 

The functionality of Overcooked is actually amazingly simple . With only three main functions moving, an action, and a speed boost testing the game would be simple. the only function that would take more than one test would be the actions. Being that all the actions are very similar only the starting and ending of an action differ each of these would need to be tested.
