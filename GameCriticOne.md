For the king is a very fun, time-eating game that is easy to play but hard to master. The game is a good mix of strategy, RPG and Roguelike all in a hexagon tabletop format.  This game comes from the developers IronOak Games based in Vancouver, BC. 

Looking at For the King, from the perspective of a tester, one functionality that would need to be tested is the difficulty scaling when creating a new game. Depending on the map, the player can choose from up to three difficulties each with different variables controlling game play. This functionality could be checked by seeing if the appropriate values change in a created game. The next mechanic that could be looked at is loading the selected map. I think the best way to approach this would be a functionality test or an automated test. The functionality could quickly be checked to see if the selection matches the map. This game has a progression system where currency, called lore, is earned through each playthrough. The amount of lore earned per playthrough will need to be tested as well. The result should be lore is correctly given during gameplay. On game ending, the lore is saved to the running total for the player.

These examples are only a few of many that a QA team would need to look at when testing this game.
