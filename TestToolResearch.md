# Product: qTest
# Developer: QASymphony

# Features 
* The main feature I think of qTest is it's flexiability and full featured options of intergerating other tools so you do not need any other apps besides this one.
* A very useful feature of this app in my opinion is how its designed to intergrate with different tools. Such as Selenium, Bamboo, Jenkins, Jira, Blueprint and Rally to list just a few. 
* Looking at the tool itself without intergrations the main use is test orgnization. It allows managing test by adding, executing, and also allows the ability to capture per test data and store it. 
* Another feature is the ability to create reports and graphs in app. qTest also allows the ability to filter reports and share. Some other options is to look just at the metrics of the reports. 

1. Does this tool do any test case storage?  
  Yes it seems to have source control for the test to look back at test and results.
2. Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?  
  Yes you can link requirements. 
3. If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?  
  There is an automated option by intergration but also has its on automation tool called qTest APIs . Being able to use intergration gives many options for languages.
