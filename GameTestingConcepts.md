## •	After watching some of the testing activities required to test Halo, name two skills that are important for a tester to have?
Patience and a meticulous personality. 

## •	What do you think is hardest about being a tester based watching the video?
The hardest part to me seems to be the amount of times each part needs to be checked and rechecked. I can’t imagine how frustrating that might be to do the same thing 100s or 1000s of times. From the prospective of a player, going through the same part more than 3 times is frustrating. Whereas each tester must go through that same part 100s of times.

## •	What is something new you learned about being a tester? Or something you found interesting?
Some of the tools they used even on games this old was very interesting. The one that most caught my interest was the map with the overlaid player feedback points.  It’s invaluable to see exactly where and when a player data point happened. The data point could be where a player is getting frustrated or how many times a player died in that particular place.
