## Details  
Game Title: Zero Caliber VR
Developer: XREAL Games
Publisher: XREAL Games
Release Date: November 9th, 2018 
## Summary
Zero Caliber is a VR first person shooter with a focus on realistic gun play. It is a mission based game that
can be played either online coop or solo. A main feature of the game is having your own armory where you can
build and customize weapons with different attachments like a scope, laser, silencer and grips. 

## Final Thoughts
Zero Caliber surprised me with how they handled shooting in vr as usually it is clunky at best. An example of this is how they handled spam firing with guns since there is no actual recoil for the player. If the player keeps firing the gun without letting it fall down after recoil it will fly out of your hands. 
Overall the game felt realistic which is no small feat when doing a shooter in vr. From my experience most other vr shooting games feel like you are shooting toys with no recoil and perfect accuracy. In Zero Caliber all guns have varying amounts of recoil and accuracy as well as very realistic lengths which can greatly affect the ability to use the gun. I quickly realized how much of a factor gun length play into after going from a pistol to a rifle. The distance to reach to reload and to hold the gun with two hands to avoid the gun flying off played a big factor into reaction time. I feel this is a great way to simulate the awkwardness when using a larger gun compared to a smaller one without being able to give weight to objects in vr. 
I am very excited to see this game come to a full release as what I played was a well made demo that gave the ability to test all mechanics of the game.
